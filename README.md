## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### PROJECT: 
TEMPERATURE CONVERTER

### OBJECTIVE: 
To develop a user-friendly C program that accurately converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program will prompt users to input a temperature in one of these scales and output the equivalent temperatures in the other two scales. This tool aims to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to perform temperature conversions, enhancing their understanding and application of different temperature measurement units.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1. Standard Input/Output Library (stdio.h):
The stdio.h library is included at the beginning of the program. It provides functionalities for input and output operations, such as printf and scanf.

2. Function Prototypes:
The program declares function prototypes for celsiusToFahrenheitAndKelvin, fahrenheitToCelsiusAndKelvin, and kelvinToCelsiusAndFahrenheit at the beginning. This helps the compiler to understand the functions' signatures before their actual definitions.

3. Main Function:
The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It contains the main logic for displaying the menu, getting user input, and calling the appropriate conversion functions based on user choice.

4. User Input Handling:
The program uses scanf to get user input for both the menu choice and the temperature value. This allows the program to interact with the user and accept inputs.

5. Conditional Statements (switch case):
A switch statement is used to handle the user's menu choice. Based on the choice, the appropriate conversion function is called.

6. Temperature Conversion Functions:
The program defines three functions to perform the actual temperature conversions:
celsiusToFahrenheitAndKelvin: Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
fahrenheitToCelsiusAndKelvin: Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
kelvinToCelsiusAndFahrenheit: Converts a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.
